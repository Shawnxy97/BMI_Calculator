## Main Takeaways

### Stateful & Stateless Widgets
Flutter Widgets are like Components in React, all the things we see in an app are organized in different widgets.  Stateless widgets are those that never change, like Text widgets, Icon widgets, while stateful widgets are those widgets that users can interact with (dynamic).

### Routes

The way Flutter implements navigation to different routes is like a stack. When we click on a button that is supposed to lead us to a new page, Flutter pushes the new page onto the screen. When we want to go back to the previous page, Flutter pops the current page and shows the previous page in the stack.
